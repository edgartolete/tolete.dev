            and in that time, he’s consistently impressed me with both his
            technical skill and his team spirit. Edgar brings a strong depth of
            knowledge to the table and is always generous in sharing his
            insights and ideas with others.

            He’s approachable, easy to work with, and brings a great sense of
            humor that makes team collaboration enjoyable. Beyond his technical
            contributions, Edgar has shown clear potential as a leader—he’s
            proactive, thoughtful, and has a natural ability to inspire those
            around him. Any team would be lucky to have him.

            year now—first at Volenday and now at Vtime—and throughout that

            effective team leader. He brings structure and clarity to our
            projects, ensuring that deadlines are met without compromising code
            quality or user experience. His ability to break down complex
            problems, guide the team through challenges, and maintain a calm,
            solutions-oriented mindset makes him a go-to person for both
            technical and strategic decisions.

            a key factor in the success of several major initiatives we&apos;ve
            delivered together.

            team success and continuous improvement.
